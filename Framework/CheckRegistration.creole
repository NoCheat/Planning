=CheckRegistration=

We want to achieve some basic goals here:
* Registration can be simple, possible with one class (advanced use may be more complex).
* On-the-fly registration and removal of checks.
* Check types also have to be as flexible (register, remove, use the same type but rule take priority over another available implementation).
* Cross-check data access and compatibility aspects are important (e.g. possibility to relate to other checks for listener processing order).
* Checks can at least somehow query if their dependencies are present (data sources, events, packets, other checks, similar).

Extended goals can be:
* Some dependency / factory management is provided, so checks and components can get added / removed as available/needed.
