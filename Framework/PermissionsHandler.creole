PermissionsHandler
========
The PermissionsHandler will handle permissions for players.

===Tasks===

===Toughs===
* SuperPerm based permissions handling
* Permissions parents should be supported here
* An option to ignore OP status maybe?
* Permissions should be cached for performance gain (MyPictures: I vote that only check permissions should be cached but administration commands shouldn't be cached)
