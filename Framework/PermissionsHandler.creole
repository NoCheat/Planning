PermissionsHandler
========
The PermissionsHandler will handle permissions for players.

===Tasks===
* SuperPerm based permissions handling
* Permissions should be cached for performance gain (MyPictures: I vote that only check permissions should be cached but administration commands shouldn't be cached)
* Permissions parents should be supported here

===Toughs===

* An option to ignore OP status maybe?
